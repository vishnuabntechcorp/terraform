Dear contributors,

We are really pleased to see you interested in contributing.

There are many different ways to contribute to Report Portal's development, just find the one that best fits with your skills. Examples of contributions we would love to receive include:

- **Code patches**
- **Documentation improvements**

Big features are also welcome but if you want to see your contributions included in Report Portal codebase we strongly recommend you start by initiating a chat though our Team.

### Review Then Commit
Currently we follow **Review Then Commit (RTC)** philosophy.
> Review Then Commit (RTC) is more restrictive and demands a mandatory review of all changes before they are committed to the GitHub. The advocates of this model suggest this drill improves the quality of new contributions.

Report Portal has dedicated team of server side and front-end developers, along with QA, BA and UI/UX teams.
Our team members will review merge requests, comment and accept in order to follow best practices and improve quality.

With collected respect, top contributors will be granted as **gate keepers**, to be able to make commits without review. And review commits of other contributors.
